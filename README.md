## Javascript
I use all solutions with Javascript. Links that always help me:

* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
* [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

## Solution
So, for the first solution, it's free-mode. I applied all the basic and learned knowledge of Javascript that I know. For my second solution, I'm planning to use just all manual indexing without methods, e.g., for, if, push, and indexing like [i]. I think it's the best approach to learning and understanding Javascript or another programming language. For the third or next solution, I think I'll try to make efficient and more descriptive solutions in Codewars.

## GPT Zero
GPT Zero is an anti-hero of chatGPT. I tried to scan my code in GPT Zero, and most of the time the result is AI-generated.
